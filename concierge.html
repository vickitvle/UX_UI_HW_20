                <p>When planning long-term trips that require two or more lodging options, <span class="highlight">modern travelers seldom have the time and motivation to actively navigate through different apps to map out and compare accommodations that align with their budget and various locations throughout their journey.</span></p>

       <p><span class="highlight">This project was not only my first UX/UI Design Bootcamp challenge but my first attempt at playing the role of a UX Designer!</span> During the research phase, a fellow classmate and I conducted user interviews together, synthesizing our research findings into an affinity map and user persona.
        <br><br>
        We were then responsible for our own individual project using the data we collected. <span class="highlight">Thus, I was solely responsible for the subsequent design and testing phases of this project, with a heavy emphasis on prototyping, visual design, and iterating designs based on user feedback.</span>
        </p>
        </div>

        <div id="research"> 
          <h1>Research</h1>
          <p>Our first task upon receiving the challenge of designing a travel planning mobile app was to narrow down the scope into a topic we felt had opportunities to explore. <span class="highlight">We decided on the experience of booking accommodations for long-term travel, and arrived at four objectives to help guide us through the research process:</span></p>
            <br><ul class="objectives">
                <li>01. Uncover the decision making process behind how groups of 2 or more travelers search and book accommodations for long-term trips.
                </li>
                <li>02. Discover what needs must be met when travelers book accommodations for long-term travel.
                </li>
                <li>03. Discover what pain points travelers encounter when booking accommodations for long-term trips.
                </li>
                <li>04. Learn how travelers manage and organize bookings.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Interviews & Affinity Mapping /</h3>
            <br>
            <p>With our research objectives in mind, <span class="highlight">we conducted ten one-on-one remote interviews over Zoom with our target demographic: working-class adults with schedules that alotted time for long-term trips spanning at least 4 days. We organized our results into an affinity map</span> to further examine our audience's goals, needs, motivations, and frustrations when it came to planning for travel.</p>
            <br>
            <center><img class="objectives" src="images/Affinity Diagram1.jpg" width="800" height="460" alt="Affinity Diagram"></center>
            <br>
            <p>Based on user interviews, we discovered that:</p>
                <ul class="objectives">
                    <li>01. <span class="highlight">Users plan months ahead for long-term trips</span>, and spend <span class="highlight">upwards to a month searching for and booking accommodations.</span></li>
                    <li>02. <span class="highlight">Users typically rely on several different apps to compare accommodations</span> and their prices, as well as any places of interest nearby.</li>
                    <li>03. The main <span class="highlight">frustration</span> that users experience when searching for accommodations is <span class="highlight">the lack of transparency in regard to fees and policies.</span></li>
                    <li>04. <span class="highlight">Affordability and ease of access to points of interest during long-term trips are prioritized</span> by users, especially when planning with others.</li>
                </ul>
            <br><br>
            <p>It was insightful to learn about our interviewees' definition of travel, what it means to them, and how they navigate these newly defined parameters of traveling, especially during a pandemic. <span class="highlight">We synthesized our discoveries into a user persona which not only kept us grounded throughout the remainder of the project, but served as a reminder as to <i>why</i> we were doing it:</span></p>
        
            <center><img src="images/Persona.png" id="persona" width="700" height="400" alt="Persona"></center>
            <hr>
            <h3>Competitor Analysis /</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Throughout our user interviews, we learned about the different mobile apps travelers were familiar with to search for and book accommodations. <span class="highlight">We conducted a competitor analysis with Booking.com and Trivago to evaluate how these commonly used travel apps operated before we began brainstorming possible solutions.</span></p>
            <center>
                <img src="images/booking.png" width="90" height="90">
                <img src="images/trivago.png" width="100" height="100">
            </center>
            <br>
            <p>At the time of exploration, we discovered a few missed opportunities:</p>
            <ul class="objectives">
                <li>01. Users cannot book accommodations through the Trivago app; <span class="highlight">they are instead externally redirected to the site source of the listing.</span></li>
                <li>02. Although Booking.com and Trivago have an integrated map that allows users to explore the area around listings, <span class="highlight">the map is still quite limited in showing what is around the listing</span>, such as restaurants, activities, stores, etc.</li>
                <center><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1anWhXv0cH_hHvOUNIsIBJowMKT6ZxEtw3WihQL3vE7U/edit" target="_blank"><button class="view">VIEW IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS</button></a></center>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <p>Based on user research and competitive analysis findings, we felt there was an opporunity in <span class="highlight">creating an app that personalized and streamlined the planning experience for users, allowing them to easily find and book a variety of accommodations based on their interests and duration of travel.</span> With that in mind, it was time to put the pen to paper!</p>
        </div>        
        
    <div id="design">         
        <h1>Design</h1>
        <p>Now, it was time for me to fully take the reins of this project and begin the brainstorming process. I used the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yaZwppTjrfDBMC0jExTSdnb0nEZYF16DDc16KmvIND4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">"I Like, I Wish, What If..."</a> method to freely ideate any possible solutions I could think of. After accessing all of my ideas, I landed on three feasible features to work on:</p>
            <ul class="objectives">
                <li>01. Booking multiple transparently priced accommodations at once.</li>
                <li>02. Seeing activities or any areas of interest on the same map as accommodations.</li>
                <li>03. A repository for all types of accommodations.</li>
            </ul>
        <br><br>
        <p>Unfortunately, "Airbnb nap stations" did not make the cut, however, <span class="highlight">each of the features mentioned above addressed the pain points discovered during the user research phase: lack of transparency regarding fees, and the nuisance of switching between different apps to find information relevant to booking accommodations, especially for long-term travel.</span> To demonstrate a scenario in which each feature is utilized, I created a user journey map that highlighted each stage and touchpoint:</p>
        <br>
        <center><img src="images/journeymap.png" width="900" alt="User Journey Map"></center>
        <br>
        <p>I generated a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xUmdpnn9-Y-6p2d5aE7YttNxvGYdgim9/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">user flow</a> to make sense of the user journey map. <span class="highlight">The user flow emphasized the process of planning, booking, and organizing multiple accommodations throughout different locations during a week-long road trip.</span> In Valerieâ€™s scenario, she is embarking on a weeklong road trip with her family from Seattle to San Francisco and needs multiple lodging options along her travel route that could accommodate her family.</p>
        <br>
        <center><img src="images/sketches.png" width="900" alt="Sketches"></center>
        <br>
        <p>Since the concept of this mobile app includes sharing a repository of accommodations, I didn't want users to feel overwhelmed looking for lodging options. <span class="highlight">To make searching feel more personalized, engaging, and streamlined, a brief, preliminary interests survey was added to the onboarding process.</span> By doing so, the process of <span class="highlight">combing through information relevant to accommodations, such as location, price, pictures, and things to do nearby that interests the user (priorities discussed during the user research phase) could be mitigated.</span></p>
        <br>
        <center><img src="images/wireframes.png" width="900" alt="Wireframes"></center>
        <br>
        <p>The sketches were a rough draft to demonstrate the feature of booking multiple accommodations all at once for a long-term trip such as the roadtrip that Valerie is taking. <span class="highlight">To test the efficacy of this feature, I converted the sketches into lo-fi wireframes via Adobe XD, and InVision to test the prototype.</span></p>

        <div id="testing">         
            <h1>Testing & Iterations</h1>
            <p>After two weeks of researching, ideating, and designing, it was time to test the decisions I made. <span class="highlight">I conducted four remote usability tests over Zoom with the lo-fi prototype using InVision.</span> Since it was my first time coordinating usability tests, I was thoroughly surprised at the results, and learned many key insights from the feedback I received:</p>
